title: Depth-3 Arithmetic Circuits for S^2_n(X) and Extensions of the  Graham-Pollack Theorem
abstract:   We consider the problem of computing the second elementary symmetricpolynomial S^2_n(X) using depth-three arithmetic circuits of the form "sum ofproducts of linear forms". We consider this problem over several fields anddetermine EXACTLY the number of multiplication gates required. The lower boundsare proved for inhomogeneous circuits where the linear forms are allowed tohave constants; the upper bounds are proved in the homogeneous model. For realsand rationals, the number of multiplication gates required is exactly n-1; inmost other cases, it is \ceil{n/2}. This problem is related to theGraham-Pollack theorem in algebraic graph theory. In particular, our resultsanswer the following question of Babai and Frankl: what is the minimum numberof complete bipartite graphs required to cover each edge of a complete graph anodd number of times? We show that for infinitely many n, the answer is\ceil{n/2}.
