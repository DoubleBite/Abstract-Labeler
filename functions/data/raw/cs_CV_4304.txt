title: Supervised Classification of RADARSAT-2 Polarimetric Data for Different  Land Features
abstract:   The pixel percentage belonging to the user defined area that are assigned tocluster in a confusion matrix for RADARSAT-2 over Vancouver area has beenanalysed for classification. In this study, supervised Wishart and SupportVector Machine (SVM) classifiers over RADARSAT-2 (RS2) fine quadpol mode SingleLook Complex (SLC) product data is computed and compared. In comparison withconventional single channel or dual channel polarization, RADARSAT-2 is fullypolarimetric, making it to offer better land feature contrast forclassification operation.
